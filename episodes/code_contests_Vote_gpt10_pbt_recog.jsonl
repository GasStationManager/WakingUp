In these cases, the result should be `\"?\"` because the unknown votes could sway the result in either direction, making it uncertain.\n\nLet's analyze the candidate solution and identify the issue:\n\n```lean\ndef vote_result (x y z : Nat) : String :=\n  let min_upvotes := x\n  let max_upvotes := x + z\n  let min_downvotes := y\n  let max_downvotes := y + z\n\n  if max_upvotes < min_downvotes then\n    \"-\"\n  else if max_downvotes < min_upvotes then\n    \"+\"\n  else if min_upvotes = min_downvotes then\n    \"0\"\n  else\n    \"?\"\n```\n\nThe issue lies in the condition `else if min_upvotes = min_downvotes then \"0\"`. This condition does not account for the possibility of unknown votes (`z > 0`) that could change the balance between upvotes and downvotes. If `z > 0`, even if `x = y`, the result should be `\"?\"` because the unknown votes could lead to either more upvotes or more downvotes.\n\nTo fix this, we need to adjust the logic to correctly handle cases where `z > 0` and `x = y`. Let's update the code:\n\n1. Check if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` for `\"-\"`.\n2. Check if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` for `\"+\"`.\n3. Check if `z = 0` and `min_upvotes = min_downvotes` for `\"0\"`.\n4. Otherwise, return `\"?\"`.\n\nLet's implement this fix and verify it.\ndef vote_result (x y z : Nat) : String :=\n  let min_upvotes := x\n  let max_upvotes := x + z\n  let min_downvotes := y\n  let max_downvotes := y + z\n\n  if max_upvotes < min_downvotes then\n    \"-\"\n  else if max_downvotes < min_upvotes then\n    \"+\"\n  else if z = 0 ∧ min_upvotes = min_downvotes then\n    \"0\"\n  else\n    \"?\"\n\n-- Testing the updated function against the failed test cases\n#eval vote_result 0 0 1  -- Expected: \"?\"\n#eval vote_result 1 1 2  -- Expected: \"?\"\n#eval vote_result 2 2 5  -- Expected: \"?\"\n#eval vote_result 1 1 1  -- Expected: \"?\"\n#eval vote_result 0 0 5  -- Expected: \"?\"\n#eval vote_result 0 0 2  -- Expected: \"?\"\n#eval vote_result 1 1 5  -- Expected: \"?\"\n#eval vote_result 0 0 1  -- Expected: \"?\"\n#eval vote_result 6 6 5  -- Expected: \"?\"\n{'success': True, 'output': '\"?\"\\n\"?\"\\n\"?\"\\n\"?\"\\n\"?\"\\n\"?\"\\n\"?\"\\n\"?\"\\n\"?\"\\n', 'error': None}", "tests_passed": 4, "tests_total": 4}}
