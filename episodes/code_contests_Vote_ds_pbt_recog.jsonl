If `min_up > max_down`, the result is `+`.\n2. If `min_down > max_up`, the result is `-`.\n3. If `min_up == min_down && max_up == max_down`, the result is `0`.\n4. Otherwise, the result is `?`.\n\n### Issues with the Candidate Solution\nThe main issue is in the third condition:\n- `min_up == min_down && max_up == max_down` is not sufficient to conclude that the result is `0`. This condition only checks the extremes, but it doesn't account for all possible intermediate values of `k` (the number of unknown votes that are upvotes).\n\nFor example, when `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`:\n- `min_up = 1`, `max_up = 2`\n- `min_down = 1`, `max_down = 2`\n- The condition `min_up == min_down && max_up == max_down` is true, so the candidate solution returns `0`.\n- However, if `k = 0`, then `x + k = 1` and `y + (z - k) = 2`, so the result is `-`.\n- If `k = 1`, then `x + k = 2` and `y + (z - k) = 1`, so the result is `+`.\n- Therefore, the result is uncertain, and the correct output should be `?`.\n\n### Fixing the Candidate Solution\nTo fix the solution, we need to ensure that the result is `0` only if for all possible values of `k`, `x + k = y + (z - k)`. This can be simplified to checking if `x - y = z - 2k` for all `k`. However, this is only possible if `x - y = 0` and `z = 0`, which means `x = y` and `z = 0`.\n\nThus, the condition for `0` should be `x == y && z == 0`.\n\n### Modified Solution\n```lean\ndef vote_result (x y z : Nat) : String :=\n  let min_up := x\n  let max_up := x + z\n  let min_down := y\n  let max_down := y + z\n  if min_up > max_down then\n    \"+\"\n  else if min_down > max_up then\n    \"-\"\n  else if x == y && z == 0 then\n    \"0\"\n  else\n    \"?\"\n```\n\n### Testing the Modified Solution\nLet's test the modified solution with the failing inputs from the property-based testing.\n\n1. `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`:\n   - `min_up = 1`, `max_up = 2`\n   - `min_down = 1`, `max_down = 2`\n   - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n2. `x = 3`, `y = 3`, `z = 1`:\n   - `min_up = 3`, `max_up = 4`\n   - `min_down = 3`, `max_down = 4`\n   - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n3. `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`:\n   - `min_up = 0`, `max_up = 1`\n   - `min_down = 0`, `max_down = 1`\n   - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n4. `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 2`:\n   - `min_up = 0`, `max_up = 2`\n   - `min_down = 0`, `max_down = 2`\n   - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n5. `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `z = 2`:\n   - `min_up = 2`, `max_up = 4`\n   - `min_down = 2`, `max_down = 4`\n   - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n6. `x = 3`, `y = 3`, `z = 2`:\n   - `min_up = 3`, `max_up = 5`\n   - `min_down = 3`, `max_down = 5`\n   - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n7. `x = 4`, `y = 4`, `z = 2`:\n   - `min_up = 4`, `max_up = 6`\n   - `min_down = 4`, `max_down = 6`\n   - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n8. `x = 4`, `y = 4`, `z = 5`:\n   - `min_up = 4`, `max_up = 9`\n   - `min_down = 4`, `max_down = 9`\n   - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n9. `x = 3`, `y = 3`, `z = 3`:\n   - `min_up = 3`, `max_up = 6`\n   - `min_down = 3`, `max_down = 6`\n   - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n10. `x = 4`, `y = 4`, `z = 8`:\n    - `min_up = 4`, `max_up = 12`\n    - `min_down = 4`, `max_down = 12`\n    - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n11. `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`:\n    - `min_up = 0`, `max_up = 1`\n    - `min_down = 0`, `max_down = 1`\n    - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n12. `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `z = 2`:\n    - `min_up = 2`, `max_up = 4`\n    - `min_down = 2`, `max_down = 4`\n    - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n13. `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`:\n    - `min_up = 1`, `max_up = 2`\n    - `min_down = 1`, `max_down = 2`\n    - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n14. `x = 4`, `y = 4`, `z = 4`:\n    - `min_up = 4`, `max_up = 8`\n    - `min_down = 4`, `max_down = 8`\n    - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n15. `x = 4`, `y = 4`, `z = 4`:\n    - `min_up = 4`, `max_up = 8`\n    - `min_down = 4`, `max_down = 8`\n    - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n16. `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 2`:\n    - `min_up = 1`, `max_up = 3`\n    - `min_down = 1`, `max_down = 3`\n    - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n17. `x = 2`, `y = 2`, `z = 2`:\n    - `min_up = 2`, `max_up = 4`\n    - `min_down = 2`, `max_down = 4`\n    - `x == y` is true, but `z != 0`, so the result is `?`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe modified solution correctly handles the failing cases by ensuring that the result is `0` only when `x == y` and `z == 0`.
